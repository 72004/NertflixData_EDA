# NertflixData_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aimed at uncovering insights, identifying patterns, and preparing data for further analysis or modeling. The project demonstrates the use of Python and key data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, visualize, and analyze the dataset.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Data Visualization: Creation of insightful plots (bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc.) to understand data distribution and relationships.
Statistical Analysis: Using descriptive statistics to summarize and describe the dataset.
Feature Insights: Highlighting key features and their importance for decision-making or modeling.
Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Use Cases
Understand data distributions and trends.
Gain insights into key features and their relationships.
Prepare data for machine learning models or other statistical analyses.
Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements!
